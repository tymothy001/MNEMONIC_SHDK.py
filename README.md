Loads mnemonics and address patterns from files.
Processes each mnemonic, generating Bitcoin addresses and checking if they match the patterns.
Saves results to a file and updates a progress bar.
Displays the total number of found matching addresses after processing is complete.
Input Files:

12words.txt: Contains mnemonics, each on a new line.
w11.txt: Contains Bitcoin address patterns (full or partial).
Output File:

f222.txt: Contains found matching mnemonics and their corresponding Bitcoin addresses.
Running the Script:

Place mnemonics in the file 12words.txt.
Place Bitcoin address patterns in the file w11.txt.
Run the script from the command line.
Monitoring Progress:

The script's progress will be displayed in the console.

Script Usage:

The script is useful for quickly processing and checking a large number of mnemonics against specific Bitcoin address patterns. This can be beneficial in various research, security, or auditing scenarios.

Additional Notes:

The script can be modified according to your needs by adding new functions or changing how mnemonics are processed.
Remember that the script works only with BIP39 mnemonics.
Use caution when working with mnemonics, as they contain sensitive information.
